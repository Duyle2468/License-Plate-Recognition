# License Plate Recognition
License Plate Rocognition for Subject's Project.
Allow user to select image from PC and detect license plate in that image (motorbikes' plates only).

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project for testing and judging purposes. For more information about this project, please read the reports in baocao.docx or baocao.pdf.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.6.8 <br>
Tensorflow GPU 1.12 <br>
Cuda 9 <br>
CudNN 7.3 <br>
Anaconda Virtual Environment (for training only)

### Installing
[Python 3.6.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) <br>
[Tensorflow GPU 1.12](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) <br>
[Cuda 9](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64) <br>
[CudNN 7.3](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html) <br>
[Anaconda Virtual Environment](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10#2-set-up-tensorflow-directory-and-anaconda-virtual-environment)

### Method
  1. Train model using Faster R-CNN, with the help of TensorFlow GPU. <br>
  2. Using trained model to detect license plate from picture. <br>
  
### How to run
  Clone this project using github
  Install all dependencies needed
  Open UI.py and build that file
  There should be an UI there if you done it correctly.
